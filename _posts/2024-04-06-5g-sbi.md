title: "On 5G Service-Based Interface (SBI)"
---

The 5G Service-Based Interface (SBI) serves as a foundational element within the architecture 
of 5G networks, facilitating communication and interaction between various network functions. 
As 5G networks are designed to be highly flexible, scalable, and efficient, the SBI plays a 
critical role in enabling seamless connectivity, dynamic service orchestration, and 
interoperability across diverse network elements. Let's delve into a detailed introduction of 
the 5G Service-Based Interface:

  - **Definition and Purpose**: The 5G Service-Based Interface (SBI) is a standardized
    interface within the 5G architecture, defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project
    (3GPP). It establishes a set of protocols, procedures, and messaging formats for
    communication between different network functions, allowing them to exchange information,
    invoke services, and coordinate actions. The primary purpose of the SBI is to enable
    service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles within 5G networks, promoting modularity,
    flexibility, and reusability of network functions.

  - **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: At the core of the 5G SBI is the concept of
    service-oriented architecture (SOA), which advocates for the decomposition of network
    functionality into discrete, interoperable services. By encapsulating network functions
    as services with well-defined interfaces, SOA enables greater agility, scalability, and
    composability within the network. The SBI embodies the principles of SOA by providing a
    standardized framework for service discovery, invocation, and composition, facilitating
    dynamic service provisioning and adaptation.

  - **Interface Abstraction**: The 5G SBI abstracts the underlying network infrastructure,
    allowing network functions to interact in a vendor-neutral and technology-agnostic manner.
    This abstraction layer shields higher-layer applications and services from the complexities
    of the underlying network, promoting interoperability and innovation. By adhering to
    standardized interface specifications, vendors and operators can develop and deploy network
    functions independently, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of interoperable solutions.

  - **Protocol Stack**: The 5G SBI is built upon a modern protocol stack, leveraging
    industry-standard protocols such as HTTP/2, RESTful APIs, and JSON (JavaScript Object
    Notation) for communication between network functions. These lightweight, web-friendly
    protocols enable efficient data exchange, asynchronous messaging, and stateless interactions,
    ideal for dynamic service orchestration and resource management in 5G networks. Additionally,
    the SBI may utilize protocols such as gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) for high-performance,
    bi-directional communication between network functions.

  - **Functional Components**: Within the 5G SBI, various functional components play distinct
    roles in facilitating service discovery, invocation, and management. These components include
    Service Consumer, Service Provider, Service Registry, Service Gateway, and Service Orchestrator.
    The Service Consumer initiates service requests, while the Service Provider delivers the
    requested services. The Service Registry maintains a catalog of available services, while the
    Service Gateway serves as a proxy for routing and security. The Service Orchestrator coordinates
    the deployment and lifecycle management of services, ensuring optimal resource utilization and
    service quality.

  - **Dynamic Service Orchestration**: One of the key advantages of the 5G SBI is its support for
    dynamic service orchestration, allowing network functions to be instantiated, configured, and
    interconnected on-the-fly in response to changing demand and network conditions. Through
    automated service discovery, composition, and provisioning, the SBI enables efficient resource
    allocation, traffic optimization, and service chaining, maximizing the utilization of network
    resources and enhancing user experience.

For instance:

  - Namf: SBI exposed by Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)
  - Nsmf: SBI exposed by Session Management Function (SMF)
  - Nnef: SBI exposed by Network Exposure Function (NEF)
  - Npcf: SBI exposed by Policy Control Function  (PCF)
  - Nudm: SBI exposed by Unified Data Management (UDM)

The registration of a User Equipment (UE) in a 5G network involves several steps, including 
authentication, authorization, and the establishment of a connection with the network's core. 
Here's a detailed overview of the registration procedure with a focus on the HTTP/2 messages 
involved:

  - **Initial Access and Authentication Request**: When a UE initially accesses the 5G network, it
    sends an initial registration request to the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF),
    which acts as the control plane node for access management. This request is typically sent over
    a secure connection using HTTP/2, initiated by the UE's User Plane Function (UPF). The HTTP/2
    request contains information such as the UE's identity (e.g., International Mobile Subscriber
    Identity or IMSI), capabilities, and location.

  - **Authentication and Security Setup**: Upon receiving the registration request, the AMF
    initiates the authentication process by requesting authentication vectors from the
    Authentication Server Function (AUSF). The AUSF responds with authentication vectors
    (RAND, AUTN) and authentication key (K) based on the UE's identity. The AMF uses these
    authentication vectors and the stored security parameters to authenticate the UE and d
    erive session keys for secure communication. HTTP/2 messages exchanged during this phase
    typically include authentication request/response payloads, encrypted with security keys
    derived from the authentication process.

  - **Registration Procedure**: After successful authentication, the AMF proceeds with the
    registration procedure, assigning temporary identifiers and establishing a session context
    for the UE. The AMF may allocate resources and set up policies based on the UE's profile and
    service requirements. HTTP/2 messages exchanged during this phase include registration
    request/response payloads, confirming the successful establishment of the session context.

  - **Establishment of Data Path**: Following registration, the AMF coordinates with the UPF to
    establish the data path for the UE, allowing data packets to be forwarded between the UE and
    external networks. This involves setting up tunnels, configuring QoS parameters, and applying
    traffic policies based on the UE's subscription and network conditions. HTTP/2 messages
    exchanged between the AMF and UPF may include signaling messages to establish and manage data
    tunnels, update QoS settings, and handle mobility events.

  - **Finalization and Confirmation**: Once the data path is established, the AMF sends a
    confirmation message to the UE, indicating the successful registration and activation of
    services. The UE may also send acknowledgment messages to confirm the reception of configuration
    parameters and activation of services. HTTP/2 messages exchanged during this phase include
    confirmation/response payloads, signaling the completion of the registration process.

Throughout the registration procedure, HTTP/2 messages serve as the transport mechanism for 
exchanging control plane signaling between the AMF, and other network elements. These messages carry 
essential information for authentication, session establishment, resource allocation, and service 
activation, ensuring seamless connectivity and service delivery in the 5G network. In summary, the 
5G Service-Based Interface (SBI) serves as a cornerstone of the 5G architecture, enabling modular, 
interoperable, and dynamic networking capabilities.
