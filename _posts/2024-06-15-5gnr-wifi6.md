title: "5G NR vs. WiFi"
---

5G NR (New Radio) and WiFi are both advanced wireless technologies designed
to provide high-speed connectivity, but they serve different purposes and 
have distinct characteristics. Here’s a detailed comparison.

## Spectrum and Licensing

  - 5G NR: Operates in licensed spectrum bands, ensuring controlled and 
    interference-free communication. It also uses unlicensed spectrum in some 
    cases, such as in the 5 GHz band
  - WiFi: Operates in unlicensed spectrum bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and recently, 
    6 GHz with WiFi 6E), which are free to use but can be prone to 
    interference from other devices

## Coverage and Range

  - 5G NR: Designed for wide-area coverage, providing connectivity over large 
    distances, from a few kilometers up to tens of kilometers with proper 
    infrastructure. Indoor 5G uses small cells and indoor base stations to 
    enhance coverage and performance inside buildings, addressing penetration 
    losses and ensuring high-speed connectivity in indoor environments.
  - WiFi: Intended for local area networks (LANs), covering smaller areas such 
    as homes, offices, and public hotspots, typically up to a few hundred 
    meters.

## Deployment and Infrastructure

  - 5G NR: Requires significant infrastructure investment, including base
    stations, antennas, and a supporting core network. Deployment is managed 
    by telecom operators
  - WiFi: Easier and cheaper to deploy, typically involving only a router 
    or access point. Deployment is usually managed by individuals or 
    organizations without the need for telecom operators

> 5G can integrate non-3GPP access networks (such as WiFi) for seamless 
  connectivity and enhanced coverage, allowing devices to switch between
  5G and WiFi networks without user intervention


## Speed and Latency

  - 5G NR: Offers peak speeds up to 20 Gbps and very low latency (as low 
    as 1 ms), supporting high-bandwidth and latency-sensitive applications 
    like AR/VR, real-time gaming, and autonomous driving
  - WiFi: Provides speeds up to 9.6 Gbps with reduced latency compared to 
    previous WiFi standards. It is suitable for high-speed internet access,
    streaming, and smart home applications

## Capacity and Density

  - 5G NR: Designed to support a massive number of devices per square 
    kilometer, ideal for IoT applications and dense urban environments
  - WiFi: Improved over previous WiFi generations to handle more devices 
    simultaneously, reducing congestion in environments like offices, 
    stadiums, and public areas. A single Access Point can handle few 
    handreds of simultaneous devices

## Quality of Service (QoS)

  - 5G NR: Offers sophisticated QoS mechanisms, including network 
    slicing, which allows for the creation of virtual networks tailored 
    to specific service requirements
  - WiFi 6: Implements QoS improvements through features like Orthogonal 
    Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Target Wake Time (TWT), 
    enhancing efficiency and reducing latency

## Mobility

  - 5G NR: Provides seamless mobility support, enabling users to maintain
    connectivity while moving at high speeds, such as in vehicles or trains
  - WiFi: Limited mobility, best suited for stationary or low-mobility 
    environments. Handoffs between access points can result in brief 
    connectivity interruptions

> VoWiFi (Voice over WiFi): WiFi 6 supports VoWiFi, allowing voice calls 
  to be made over WiFi networks, which can be used as a complement to 
  cellular services, especially indoors or in areas with poor cellular 
  coverage

## Use Cases

  - 5G NR: Ideal for outdoor and wide-area applications such as mobile 
    broadband, remote healthcare, smart cities, and industrial automation. 
    Indoor 5G provides enhanced indoor connectivity for enterprise 
    applications, indoor positioning, and high-speed services within 
    buildings
  - WiFi: Best for indoor and localized applications like home networking, 
    enterprise environments, and public hotspots

## 5G NR Standardization

### 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)

  - Overview: 3GPP is the primary body responsible for standardizing 5G NR. 
    It brings together seven organizational partners and a variety of industry 
    stakeholders to develop technical specifications for mobile 
    telecommunications
  - Role: Defines the radio access, core network, and service architecture 
    for 5G, ensuring global compatibility and interoperability.
  - Specifications: 3GPP releases technical specifications in a series of 
    releases. 5G NR specifications are primarily found in Release 15, Release 16, 
    and subsequent releases, which cover aspects like radio access, network 
    architecture, and network slicing

### International Telecommunication Union (ITU)

  - Overview: ITU is a specialized agency of the United Nations that allocates 
    global radio spectrum and satellite orbits, and develops the technical 
    standards ensuring networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect.
  - Role: ITU’s Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) defines the requirements 
    for 5G and incorporates 5G NR into its IMT-2020 standards framework.
  - Specifications: ITU-R M.2083 outlines the vision for 5G (IMT-2020), 
    including performance requirements and technical specifications.

## WiFi Standardization

### Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

  - Overview: IEEE is the leading body responsible for the development of WiFi 
    standards. IEEE 802.11 is the working group within IEEE that develops the 
    specifications for wireless LANs
  - Role: Develops and updates the 802.11 series of standards, including 
    802.11ax, which is commonly known as WiFi 6
  - Specifications: IEEE 802.11ax standard specifies improvements in efficiency, 
    flexibility, and scalability, enabling new and existing networks to handle 
    more users and devices

### Wi-Fi Alliance

  - Overview: The Wi-Fi Alliance is a global nonprofit association that promotes 
    WiFi technology and certifies WiFi products for interoperability
  - Role: Ensures that WiFi devices from different manufacturers work well together 
    and meet industry standards. The Wi-Fi Alliance also certifies products to 
    ensure they comply with the IEEE 802.11 specifications
  - Specifications: Provides certification for WiFi 6 devices, ensuring they meet 
    the performance and interoperability criteria set by the IEEE 802.11ax standard

# Conclusion

While both 5G NR and WiFi are designed to deliver high-speed wireless 
connectivity, 5G NR is tailored for broad, wide-area deployments with 
enhanced mobility and network management features, making it suitable
for large-scale and outdoor applications. Indoor 5G solutions extend 
this capability indoors, providing high-speed connectivity within 
buildings. WiFi, on the other hand, excels in local area networks, 
offering high speeds and improved device handling for indoor and 
smaller-scale environments. Both technologies are complementary, often 
working together with non-3GPP access to provide comprehensive wireless
coverage and connectivity. The development and standardization of 5G NR 
and WiFi 6 are governed by key industry bodies. VoWiFi further enhances 
user experience by providing reliable voice service over WiFi networks.
